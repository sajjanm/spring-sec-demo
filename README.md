# spring-sec-demo
Creating an application to leverage the power of Spring Security

# To run this application
1st create a database and the properties of the database can be found in "application.properties" file

In the very first commit, the application does connect to database to get user authentication. and here the password is not encrypted; and its simply not recommended. While in later commits it will go on implementing BCrypt to OAuth2.

Enjoy!
